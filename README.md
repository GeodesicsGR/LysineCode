# LysineCode is a high-level programming language. Currently, only the pre-release is available. This is part of our STREAM passion project, thanks if you give it a try.
# File handlings, buttons, hyperlinks, inputs, and more might be added in later versions (please add vector subspaces, we LOVE mathematics).
# Developed in Pygame, and by two students interested in computer science.
