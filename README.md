# LysineCode is a high-level programming language. Currently, only the pre-release is available. This is part of our STREAM passion project, thanks if you give it a try.
# File handlings, buttons, hyperlinks, inputs, and more might be added in later versions (please add vector subspaces, we LOVE mathematics).
# Developed in Pygame, and by two students interested in computer science.

# After Downloading, here are the steps to launch LysineCode v0.1.0 properly:
# 1. Extract the Download ZIP File - these contain key data like images and the font, so the program will crash if not extracted.
# 2. Open that folder.
# 3. Double-Click "LysineCode.exe" to launch our program!

# This .exe file was created using PyInstaller, and sometimes Windows Defender or other antivirus software may mistakenly flag it as suspicious due to its format, blocking the usage of the file.
# If this occurs, you can safely run the Python version (main.py) provided in the ZIP folder, or choose to build your own executable using the source code.

# All the code that you run will be printed in your Operating System's coding program (e.g. Powershell for Windows)

# Enjoy coding!
